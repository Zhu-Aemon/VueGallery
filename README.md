# Gallery

Gallery is a designed to be a music file manager for whoever possesses a passion for managing music locally in their PC.

You are count as a target of this Gallery program if you:

- have a passion for music quality like Hi-Res or Lossless
- prefer to keep everything in their PC in a rather nice way
- want to keep everything private and secure

Gallery runs completely locally and requires no connection with any remote server. Also, the program won't share any data with anyone besides you. Your data won't even be sent to Google Analytics to boost your experience. Enerything is perfectly secure.

Gallery is built using Vue.js, Vite and Electron, which is super portable and light. We also built everything using card UI design, which offers the best user experience. We have different versions that fits different platforms such as macOS and Windows.

Gallery offers strong history data lookup and analysis function. Nobody can know you better than yourself.
